# Graph Isomorphism Network

This program is neural network for graph classification using
Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN).
GIN was proposed in `"Keyulu Xu*, Weihua Hu*, Jure Leskovec, Stefanie Jegelka. How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks? ICLR 2019"`.
Dataset is PROTEINS in [Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels](http://graphkernels.cs.tu-dortmund.de) .

## Requirement
* python 3.6
* pytorch

And GPU is necessary.

## Usage
```
cd ./src
python3 main.py
```
